          <p>
            Welcome to Next.js PWA ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal information when you use our
            Progressive Web App (PWA).
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            This application is designed as a demonstration of PWA capabilities. It operates
            entirely on your device (client-side). We do not have a backend server, and we do not
            collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any server.

            2. Information We Access (with Your Permission)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our PWA may request access to certain device features and data to provide its full
            functionality. Access is only granted with your explicit permission through your web
            browser's consent prompts. Here is a breakdown of the features and why we need access:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-4 list-disc space-y-3 pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Geolocation:</strong> To demonstrate location-based features, we may request
              access to your device's location. Your location is used only within the app to display
              your position or provide location-relevant information and is not stored or shared.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Media Capture (Camera):</strong> For features involving media capture, we may
              request access to your device's camera. Any images or videos you capture are processed
              locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Bluetooth:</strong> To interact with nearby Bluetooth devices, we request
              your permission to access Web Bluetooth APIs. All communication with Bluetooth devices
              is handled locally on your device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Speech Recognition & Synthesis:</strong> The app may request microphone access
              for speech-to-text functionality and use your device's text-to-speech capabilities.
              Audio data is processed in real-time and is not stored.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>File Handling:</strong> The app allows you to open and edit files (e.g.,
              `.txt`, `.md`). We only access files that you explicitly select. All file processing
              happens on your device, and we do not upload your files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Authentication (Biometrics):</strong> For secure authentication, we may
              use the Web Authentication API, which can interface with your device's biometric
              sensors (e.g., fingerprint or face ID). Your biometric data is never accessed by our
              app; it is securely managed by your browser and operating system, which only inform us
              of the authentication success or failure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment Request API:</strong> To facilitate payments, we use the browser's
              Payment Request API. This API securely provides your payment details to payment
              handlers of your choice. We do not receive, process, or store your credit card numbers
              or other payment information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Network Information:</strong> The app can access information about your
              network connection (e.g., online/offline status, connection type) to provide a better
              user experience, such as enabling offline functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Screen Wake Lock:</strong> To prevent the screen from dimming or locking
              during certain activities (like reading or presenting), the app may request a screen
              wake lock. This does not involve collecting any personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Push Notifications:</strong> With your permission, we may send you push
              notifications. We store a unique, anonymous identifier on your device to send these
              notifications. You can manage this permission in your browser settings.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            Any data accessed by the app is used exclusively to enable the features you choose to
            interact with. All data processing is performed locally on your device. We do not use
            your data for advertising, tracking, or any other purpose.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <p>
            Our PWA uses your browser's local storage (e.g., Local Storage, IndexedDB) to save
            application settings or data you create within the app. This data is stored on your
            device and is not accessible to us. We rely on the security measures provided by your
            web browser and operating system to protect this data. All network communication for the
            app itself is secured via HTTPS.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">5. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            We do not share any of your personal data with third parties because we do not collect
            it. Features like the Web Share API allow you to share content with other apps, but you
            control this process, and we do not track what you share or with whom.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p>
            You have full control over the permissions you grant to our PWA. You can review and
            revoke permissions at any time through your web browser's settings for this site. You
            can also clear any data stored locally by the app by clearing your browser's cache and
            site data.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">7. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
            collect any personal data. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child
            has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take
            necessary action.

          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
            posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically for any changes.
